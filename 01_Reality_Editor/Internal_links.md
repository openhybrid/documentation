You can create links from a page to an other, the link is then resolved to the real page.

Creating a link to another page is done exactly like a normal markdown link. In the url part, start with `!` and set the absolute path to the file, omitting the numbering and file extension

A link to `01_Examples/05_Code_Highlighting.md` Would be written like this: `[Code Highlight Examples](!Examples/Code_Highlighting)`

The page generation will fail if a link is wrong.
