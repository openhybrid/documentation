Open Hybrid is a platform for interaction with everyday objects.
It combines physical objects with the benefits of a flexible augmented user interface.
This platform allows you to:
<li>Create Augmented Reality content with HTML tools</li>
<li>Create Augmented Reality without any knowledge about 3D Programming</li>
<li>Connect the functionality of objects with a simple drag and drop paradigm</li>
<li>Program your objects with Arduino, Raspberry pi</li>

Every object that you build with this platform, will be compatible and can be connected with any other object ever built with the Hybrid Objects platform.The entire platform uses Web standards. This means there are no proprietary protocols.
Hybrid Objects uses the same technologies all your favorite webpages use to communicate.<br>All data about interfaces and connections are stored within the objects themselves.<br>

Wherever you can run node.js you can run the Hybrid Object platform. We have successfully experimented with MIPS, ARM, x86 and x64 systems on Windows, Linux and OSX. We have built the Reality Editor with JavaScript and Open Frameworks.
